The understanding of Ni-based binary alloys is essential for studying Additive Manufacturing in materials design. Considering the alloys Ni-Cu, Ni-Nb and, Ni-Al the simulation shows that the microsegregation rises as the freezing zone range increases, indicating that the solute is trapped in the solid phase. Furthermore, the cellular structure is more apparent in the materials with a larger freezing zone. The microstructure is finer due to higher cooling rates and solidification speeds. The simulations use COMSOL, a thermal model numerical solver platform, to calculate two thermal parameters, temperature gradient and the solidification speed, that are used as inputs in the finite interface dissipation Phase-field model. The simulation is implemented with GPU hardware for rapid computation, and in three-dimensions to observe the cellular and columnar structures from multiple angles.
